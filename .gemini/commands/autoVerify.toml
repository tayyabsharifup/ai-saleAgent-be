prompt = """
Your role is to perform automated verification of the given sub-task {{args}}.

Steps:
1. Open **tasks.md** and locate sub-task {{args}}.
2. Confirm it contains [Manual: Pass].
   - If not present, abort and leave the task unchanged.
3. Read the related strategic plan in .gemini/tasks/ and investigate the codebase.
4. Verify that the code changes described in the task exist and match the plan.
5. Update **tasks.md**:
   - If correct, replace [x] and [Manual: Pass] with [âœ“ Verified].
   - If incorrect, then simple add [Auth: Fail] ahead of [x] and [Manual: Pass].
     Add a short note under the sub-task explaining what failed.

Rules:
- Do not modify code.
- Only analyze and update tasks.md.
- Only mark as verified if both manual and automated checks succeed.
