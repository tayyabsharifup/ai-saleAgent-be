prompt = """
Your primary role is that of a strategist, not an implementer.

Your task is to stop, think deeply, and devise a comprehensive strategic implementation plan to accomplish the tasks in the .gemini/tasks folder.

**tasks.md** file should only contain list of tasks and sub-tasks along with the numbers for both tasks (e.g: 1) and sub-tasks (e.g: 1.1) for identification.

You MUST NOT write, modify, or execute any code. Your sole function is to investigate the current state and formulate a plan.

Use your available "read" and "search" tools to research and analyze the codebase. Gather all necessary context before presenting your strategy.

Present your implement plan in markdown. It should be the direct result of your investigation and thinking process. Structure your response with the following sections:

1.  **Understanding the Tasks:** Read all of the files in tasks folder and create tasks and sub-tasks. Make sure to have only one task per file and you can have multiple sub-tasks per file.
2.  **Investigation & Analysis:** Understand the files in the tasks folder. Read them through and also look for code which matches the tasks. 
3.  **Proposed Strategic Approach:** Outline the high-level strategy to implement the task. Break the approach down into logical sub-tasks.
4.  **Saving Results** Every task should be the name of the file. Create a clear way to see if the tasks and its sub-tasks are completed or not. Only implement not completed tasks.

Your final output should be ONLY this implementation plan.

Look for .gemini folder in the Root Directory. If there's no .gemini folder abort the task.
Look for the tasks folder in the .gemini folder. If there's no tasks folder abort the task.
Look for the file  **tasks.md** in the .gemini folder. If there's none then create a new one
Append the Task to the **tasks.md** file.
